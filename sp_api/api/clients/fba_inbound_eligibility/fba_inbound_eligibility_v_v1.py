    Selling Partner API for FBA Inbound Eligibilty - v1

    With the FBA Inbound Eligibility API, you can build applications that let sellers get eligibility previews for items before shipping them to Amazon's fulfillment centers. With this API you can find out if an item is eligible for inbound shipment to Amazon's fulfillment centers in a specific marketplace. You can also find out if an item is eligible for using the manufacturer barcode for FBA inventory tracking. Sellers can use this information to inform their decisions about which items to ship Amazon's fulfillment centers.

        This operation gets an eligibility preview for an item that you specify. You can specify the type of eligibility preview that you want (INBOUND or COMMINGLING). For INBOUND previews, you can specify the marketplace in which you want to determine the item's eligibility.

The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here.
