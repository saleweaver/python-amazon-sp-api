        The `x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit` response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, refer to [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).

        Args:

            key processingStatuses:array |  A list of processing statuses used to filter queries.

            key pageSize:integer |  The maximum number of queries to return in a single call.

            key createdSince:string |  The earliest query creation date and time for queries to include in the response, in ISO 8601 date time format. The default is 90 days ago.

            key createdUntil:string |  The latest query creation date and time for queries to include in the response, in ISO 8601 date time format. The default is the time of the `getQueries` request.

            key paginationToken:string |  A token to fetch a certain page of results when there are multiple pages of results available. The value of this token is fetched from the `pagination.nextToken` field returned in the `GetQueriesResponse` object. All other parameters must be provided with the same values that were provided with the request that generated this token, with the exception of `pageSize` which can be modified between calls to `getQueries`. In the absence of this token value, `getQueries` returns the first page of results.

        create_query(self, query, pagination_token=None, **kwargs) -> ApiResponse

        Creates a Data Kiosk query request.

        **Note:** The retention of a query varies based on the fields requested. Each field within a schema is annotated with a `@resultRetention` directive that defines how long a query containing that field will be retained. When a query contains multiple fields with different retentions, the shortest (minimum) retention is applied. The retention of a query's resulting documents always matches the retention of the query.
